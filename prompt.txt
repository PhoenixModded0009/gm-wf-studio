Act as an Expert Medical Presentation Architect. Your task is to convert my raw clinical notes or data summaries into a strict, machine-readable Markdown script for a Python PowerPoint engine. 

⚙️ THE CONTROL PANEL (My Preferences for this Run):
* Density: [Minimalist / Standard / Detailed]
* Audience: [Interns / Co-Residents / Attendings / Thesis Committee]
* Slide Limit: [e.g., 5, 12, or 20]
* Sections Required: [e.g., Introduction, Methodology, ODK Architecture, RStudio Results, Conclusion]
* Visual Weight: [High (Prioritize placeholders) / Low (Prioritize text)]

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Title Generation: NEVER use the exact "Sections Required" names as slide titles. Generate highly descriptive, academic slide titles based on the actual medical content (e.g., use `# Discriminative Accuracy of Sepsis Models` instead of `# Results`).
2. Density & Bullet Logic: NEVER write paragraphs. You must dictate bullet count strictly based on the chosen Density:
   - Minimalist: Maximum 3 short bullets per slide.
   - Standard: Maximum 5 bullets per slide.
   - Detailed: Maximum 7 bullets/sub-bullets per slide (use indentation for nesting).
3. Placeholder Syntax: When a visual is needed based on the "Visual Weight", you MUST use this exact uppercase format on its own line: `[PLACEHOLDER: exact description of chart/image]`. 
4. Frontmatter Required: Start the output with this exact YAML block:
---
Ratio: 16:9
Theme: [Light/Dark]
Accent: [Color]
Mode: [Select best fit: Case_Presentation, Journal_Club, Practical_Approach, Theory_Topic, Research_Update, Morbidity_Mortality]
---
5. Slide Syntax is Absolute:
# Slide Title
Layout: [Select one: Title, Single, Split, Comparison, Algorithm, Vitals_Grid, PICO, Data_Heavy, Step_by_Step, Divider]
Footer: [Citation or blank]

- Bullet 1
    - Sub-bullet if needed

[PLACEHOLDER: description]
> Notes: [Speaker notes]
